# CopyFilesToFolders
A Python program to copy all subject files (or a select list of subject files) from one location to another and create certain subfolders if necessary
(only works for the CCDG clinic at the University of Pittsburgh)

# What I Learned
* Design a UI using tkinter and the ttk theme widgets
* Copy files using shutil module
* Manipulate file locations using os module
* Use .csv file to limit the subject files that can be moved (This way if a random list of subjects is given, the program will select out those subject files to move and not everyone)
* Compile as an .exe for both macOS and Windows
