# CopyFilesToFolders
A Python program to copy all subject files (or a select list of subject files) from one location to another and create select subfolders if necessary
(only works for the CCDG clinic University of Pittsburgh)

# What I Learned
* Use shutil module
* Use os module
* Use tkinter and the ttk theme widgets
* Use .csv file to limit the subject files that can be moved
